#### To run/view: please download data-visualisations.ipynb - it contains the interactive maps/charts. The jupyter notebook is too large to display.

This repository contains interactive visualizations of various economic datasets (e.g. GDP per capita, household income, unemployment etc.) reflecting the current and historical situation in Slovakia. The source of these datasets is DATAcube (http://datacube.statistics.sk/) which is governed by the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic (https://slovak.statistics.sk/). Regional geo JSON data was obtained from http://www.diva-gis.org/datadown.

The visualizations are in map, pie and line chart format.

If you have any Slovakian datasets you would like to see visualized please do not hesitate to contact me!
